Remnants-LEM-Mod

Map description. "Forgotten remnants of this console edition structure lie deep in the center of these highland mountains, making this last piece of the tutorial world just forgotten ruins. Yet this is a perfect place for a battle to start."

Note: 
-This map only has a Large+ variant. It is likely this map will just have one variant.

Disclaimers:
-You may notice on the other side of the wall of leaves by the bridge that there is some other areas of build, it was originally going to be the small version but I scrapped it. I tried covering it up as much as possible, but I think you guys can still see the area in spectator. So I have decided to just leave it and make it become a "Behind the scenes look" as I call it.
-Yes this map reuses the TU69 Tutorial world, I ported it from my Xbox 360 to then transformed it into a ruined theme. I wanted to represent how would the tutorial world look like after LCE got discontinued from the Minecraft Legacy XB360, Wii U, PS3, PSVITA, and PS4 Console Editons.
